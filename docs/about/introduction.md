## How to Use These Docs
On the left side of the screen, you will find the documentation navbar. On mobile devices, this can be accessed by clicking the hamburger menu in the top left. Since **MonoGame.Extended** is a set of utilities and not an engine, the documentation does not need to be read in a specific order. Each section or document is an isolated topic, so you can skip ahead or read only the ones relevant to your use case.

On the right side of the screen, you will see a table of contents that makes it easier to navigate between sections of the current document. On mobile, this can be found as a drop-down at the top of the document page.

## Prerequisite Knowledge
Where possible, the documentation is designed to be beginner-friendly. However, a baseline must be established to maintain focus on **MonoGame.Extended** functionality. Links to additional documentation will be provided when needed.

Readers should have a solid foundational skill in C# and an understanding of how to create a game project with [MonoGame](https://monogame.net). These documents are not intended to teach C#, [MonoGame](https://monogame.net), or game development in general, but to focus on the functionality provided by **MonoGame.Extended**.
