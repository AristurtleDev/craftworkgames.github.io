## Prerequisites
The following prerequisites are required when using **MonoGame.Extended** with MonoGame.

- Ensure your development environment is setup for MonoGame Development.
  - [Visual Studio 2022 Setup (Windows Only)](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_started/1_setting_up_your_development_environment_windows.html)
  - [Visual Studio Code Setup (Windows, Mac, and Linux)](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_started/1_setting_up_your_development_environment_vscode.html?tabs=windows)

- A MonoGame project
  - [Visual Studio 2022 (Windows Only)](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_started/2_creating_a_new_project_vs.html)
  - [Visual Studio Code (Windows, Mac, and Linux)](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_started/2_creating_a_new_project_netcore.html)


## Installation
**MonoGame.Extended** is distributed via a NuGet package.  You can add the NuGet pacakge to your C# project through your IDE (Visual Studio, Rider, etc) or through the Comman Line Interface (CLI) using hte `dotnet` commands

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="net-cli" label=".NET Cli" default>
    ```sh
    dotnet add package MonoGame.Extended --version 3.9.0-prerelease.4
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="package-manager" label="Package Manager">
    ```sh
    NuGet\Install-Package MonoGame.Extended -Version 3.9.0-prerelease.4
    ```
    <small>
      This command is intended to be used within the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio, as it uses NuGet module's version of [Install-Package](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/reference/ps-reference/ps-ref-install-package)
    </small>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="package-reference" label="Package Reference" default>
    ```xml
    <PackageReference Include="MonoGame.Extended" Version="3.9.0-prerelease.4" />
    ```
    <small>
        For projects that support [PackageReference](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files), copy this XML node into the project file to reference the package.

## (Optional) Setup MGCB Editor
**MonoGame.Extended** provided MonoGame Content Pipeline Extensions to extend the asset types that can be imported through the MonoGame Content Pipeline.  All asset preprocessing extensions provided as pipeline extensions can be used to load the assets at runtime from disk if you want, meaning that setting this up is optional and only needed if you are using the content pipeline for asset management in your game. 

To get started first add the `MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline` NuGet package to your MonoGame project

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="net-cli" label=".NET Cli" default>
    ```sh
    dotnet add package MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline --version 3.9.0-prerelease.4
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="package-manager" label="Package Manager">
    ```sh
    NuGet\Install-Package MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline -Version 3.9.0-prerelease.4
    ```
    <small>
      This command is intended to be used within the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio, as it uses NuGet module's version of [Install-Package](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/reference/ps-reference/ps-ref-install-package)
    </small>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="package-reference" label="Package Reference" default>
    ```xml
    <PackageReference Include="MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline" Version="3.9.0-prerelease.4" />
    ```
    <small>
        For projects that support [PackageReference](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files), copy this XML node into the project file to reference the package.

  </TabItem>  
</Tabs>


```
dotnet add package MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline
```

This package is not included as part of the base `Extended` package and must be installed separately. It won't add any build artifacts to your project; instead it will install the dependencies that are intended to be referenced from the [MonoGame Content Pipeline tool](http://www.monogame.net/documentation/?page=Pipeline).

You'll need to manually add the reference to your content file (usually `Content.mgcb`) using one of the following methods.

### Using the MonoGame Pipeline GUI

To add the reference using the Pipeline GUI tool follow these steps:

 1. Click on the **Content** node in the root of the tree.
 2. In the properties window, modify the **References** property.
 3. Find and add the `MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline.dll`. It's usually located in the **packages** folder of your solution.  The default location of the **packages** folder in .NET Core is  `C:\Users\[User]\.nuget\packages`.

### Using a text editor

An alternative way to add the reference is by manually editing the `Content.mgcb` file in a text editor or Visual Studio. Look for the references section and update it like this:

```
#-------------------------------- References --------------------------------#

/reference:..\..\packages\MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline.0.6.372\tools\MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline.dll
```

:::tip Remember
The `MonoGame.Extended.dll` and the `MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline.dll` come as a pair. Always make sure the version referenced by your game matches the version referenced by the Pipeline tool.

## Conclusion

That's it! Once you've setup `Extended` you can start using it to make your games even more awesome.
