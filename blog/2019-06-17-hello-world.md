Welcome to blog.

<!--truncate-->

More will be posted here in the future in terms of the development of `MonoGame.Extended`. For now, there is a couple things worth mentioning.

The previous owner, Dylan Wilson [@dylanwilson80](https://github.com/dylanwilson80), is stepping down due to lack of interest and time. I, Lucas Girouard-Stranks [@lithiumtoast](https://github.com/lithiumtoast), will be taking over the majority of the operations moving forward. If you have any questions or concerns I would be happy to address them on the [discord server](discord.gg/xPUEkj9).

I have a few things planned for the future of `MonoGame.Extended` but I can't get anywhere without knowing very well where/what I'm standing on. This leads to the maintenance sprint; I have scheduled a sprint for the repository for the month of June. Hopefully I can make some progress on the [existing issues](https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended/issues) and get a good feel for what is the current state of `MonoGame.Extended`.

Stay tuned for more development details and future plans.
