description: MonoGame.Extended adds support for FNA and KNI
---

**MonoGame.Extended** now has support for both [FNA](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA) and [KNI](https://github.com/kniEngine/kni).  This is possible due to the work put in by [nKast](https://github.com/nkast), so huge shoutout to him for the contribution to the library.

If you'd like to get started using MonoGame.Extended in either FNA or KNI, check out the appropriate installation document below
- [FNA Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation-fna)
- [KNI Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation-kni)
